# Milkshake Ring Holder

This is a model intended to be printed in full color and used as a ring holder. It resembles a tiny milkshake with two straws poking out and a cherry on top. The straws and cherries can be used for placing rings. An engraving in the side of the milkshake can be customized based on the image in [text.png](text.png), and currently says EST 2022.
